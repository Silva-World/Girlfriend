            <h2>Hey [Girlfriend's Name],</h2>
            <p>On this special day, National Girlfriend Day, I want to take a moment to express how grateful I am to have you by my side. You bring so much joy, love, and light into my life, and I feel incredibly lucky to have you as my partner.</p>
            <p>You're the sunshine that brightens up my day, the calm in every storm, and the safe haven where I can always be myself. I love the way you make me laugh, the way you always know how to make me feel better, and the way you support me in everything I do.</p>
            <p>I promise to always cherish, support, and love you, now and forever. Happy National Girlfriend Day, my love!</p>
            <p>With all my heart,</p>
